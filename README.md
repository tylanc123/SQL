<h1>Apply filters to SQL queries</h1>
<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>
    I am a security professional at a large organization. Part of my job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. I recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.
   
</p>
<p>
    My task is to examine the organization's data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. I'll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    <p>
    In the project demonstration, I showcased the ability to run SQL queries and apply logical operators to filter the retrieved information. Using a database, I demonstrated the execution of SQL queries to extract specific data. Furthermore, I showcased the utilization of AND, OR, and NOT operators to refine the queries and obtain more precise results.
</p>
<p>
    The demonstration highlighted the versatility of SQL in retrieving relevant information from a database by combining multiple conditions. By incorporating AND operators, I demonstrated the ability to retrieve data that satisfies multiple criteria simultaneously. The OR operator was also showcased, allowing for the retrieval of data that satisfies at least one of several specified conditions. Additionally, the NOT operator was employed to exclude data that meets certain criteria, providing further control over the query results.
</p>
<p>
    Overall, the project demonstration effectively exhibited the practical application of SQL queries and the effective utilization of logical operators to filter and refine retrieved data from a database.
